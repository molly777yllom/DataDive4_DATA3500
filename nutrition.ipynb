    "- A nutritionist creates custom diet plans for clients with medically-necessary dietary needs and wellness goals\n",
    "- They want to be able to break down prescribed diets by the meal and the recipe, and to have the ability to specify calories, macro and micronutrients, and vitamins/minerals\n",
    "- We have met with the client and obtained the following dataset detailing this information for an array of raw ingredients. The client would like us to create a database which accepts their client's specifications by the meal. This contains several parts: 1. what the client likes and doesn't like to eat; 2. the nutritionist's breakdown specifying the client's prescription for that meal. The result will return the proportions of nutrients that the client will intake in that meal. This will allow the nutritionist to fine-tune recipes after initial requirements are set.  \n",
    "- We will first study and organize the dataset to pick up on patterns across the food types\n",
    "- Then we can create a plan for the best way for the end user (the nutritionist) to access and manipulate the data. Like a program, database, etc.  \n",
